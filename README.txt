# README for Flappy Bird  #

Literally just Flappy Bird. Made this in highschool for some project. Originally Made in code.org but exported because I'm proud of it.

* `applab/applab.js` - This file contains the applab library, which has all the
  javascript that applab uses to run your app.

* `applab/applab.css` - This file contains some default CSS styling for your app.

* `index.html` - This is the html file that you designed in applab using the
  Design tab. It contains all the buttons, text inputs, and other controls for
  your app. Go here to add additional controls to your app.

* `style.css` - This file defines the custom styling for each control in your
  app that you specified under the Design tab. Go here to change the colors,
  positions, dimensions, and other properties of your app's controls.

* `code.js` - This file has all the code for the app. No way I know right.

* `assets` - This is a directory with all the asset files (crazy concept here)
